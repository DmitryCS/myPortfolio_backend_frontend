    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
    <p>I am a developer for over 3 years and have worked with many different languages . I also studied various disciplines in the field of technology, mathematics, mechanics and electronics.</p>
    <p>Today I seek groups or places to apply everything I learned and create new things and maybe, who knows, something to make me rich, famous, maybe i don’t know… you Know… That.</p>
    <h1>What I like?</h1>
    <p>I like to think and  new things, but mostly I love to learn. Every time that I can learn something new and put into practice, I’m having so much fun.</p>
    <p>Thinking about new ideas is what keeps me going. I love developing, the act of building things and seeing it work is amazing, realy! One of my passions is olympiad programing, because it puts together math and programing, and you can test yourself for strength in a short time.</p>
    <!-- <p>Music is another of my passions. I can play some instruments, yes, I can. I wouldn’t call myself a musician, I’m not really that good, but I can do some music, i think…</p> -->
    <h1>What I don’t like</h1>
    <p>Not doing something” is the best description of what I dislike. I need to keep things going on, if I stop I die. Besides that, I can probably say I do not like not to have time to do the work on time.</p>
